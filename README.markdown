# git-standup

A script that shows you what you did today (because I can never remember). I use this to prepare for standup meetings.

## Setup

- Make sure you have Ruby installed
- Clone repo
- Run `bundle install`
- Add directory to `$PATH`
- Run `git standup` from a folder containing a Git repo
